JewelToy

A macOS-native take on one of the many match-3 games like Bejeweled.

The original code by Giles Williams is available at
http://www.aegidian.org/jeweltoy/  It was written for OSX 10.2 and
the older Project Builder IDE.  The binaries he has available are
PowerPC-only, and ran the laptop battery down pretty quickly since it
had to use the Rosetta emulation.

This code contains only a few fixes required to build cleanly with XCode
14 and macOS 10.10 … 13.3, Intel and Arm
